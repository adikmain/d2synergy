# d2synergy
Tryin to synergise some Dota2 by assignment each hero to specific roles.

 Assistant logic <-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We have three main strategies to play this game. Gank > Greed > Safe > Gank.

Alternatives are (Damage > Durability > Disable > Damage)
                  (Agressive > Greed > Defensive >  Agressive)
                  
                  
Meaning of Gank strategy:
        Team with high kill potential(damage and disable), escape (uses for chase opponents)
        Good early game
        (e.g Bounty Hunter/ Weaver/ SB/ Lion/ Earth Spirit)

Meaning of Greed strategy:
        Team with high farm potential but weak in early game 
        Needs some items to blossom
        (Tinker/Warden/Furion)

Meaning of Safe strategy:
        Team with high survivability. 
        Good mid game and teamfights
        (Underlord / Lich/ Ogre / +-Treant)  <---- sometimes heroes from greed 
        
        
Gank beats Greed because heroes playing greedily are often alone and didnt build defensive items. They are easy to kill.

Greed beats safe because you get more resources out of the map while the defensive team prepares for a fight that never happens.

Safe beats gank because you are always prepared for them and beat them in engagements due to positioning and item choices.
